# Refactor To Reactive System

This Demo shows how can we refactor common PHP to be based on Message Driven following Reactive System principles.  

- Stage_1 - contains basic implementation, that you synchronous code to handle data changes and side effects
- Stage_2 - contains message driven implementation, that handles data change synchronously and side effects asynchronously 
- Stage_3 - refactors message driven architecture to be more amenable to change and readable  

This is example implementation for the article describing Reactive Systems in PHP.
